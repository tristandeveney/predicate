                        provide Slate support that felt truly accessible and
                        personal. I'm prioritizing making <strong

                        > a reality for clients, because I know teams benefit when
                        they feel they have reliable, consistent access to a dedicated
                        partner. Sometimes you just need someone who can jump on
                        a screenshare with you, and I'm committed to providing that
                        level of service."
