                        Between mid-August and mid-September 2025, Predicate
                        Higher Ed conducted an analysis of just over 1200
                        college websites (including 750+ Slate schools) in order
                        to establish benchmarking metrics you can use to
                        understand how your inquiry form compares to those of

                    <p>
                        We're sharing the findings in a series of articles. In
                        today's post, we're drilling down into how many clicks
                        it takes for someone to get from homepage to inquiry
                        form.

                    <p>
                        This metric, known as <strong>click depth</strong>, is a
                        critical performance indicator for college website
                        optimization. A high click depth can be a significant
                        barrier in the student recruitment funnel, potentially
                        causing you to lose interested prospects before they
                        ever have a chance to connect.

                        simply listed an email or phone contact for students
                        wishing to request more information, or provided a

                        We identified whether the RFI for a given institution

                        inspect the embedded or linked form, then filtered the
                        list down to schools where the form was hosted by Slate
                        (note: for purposes of this analysis, we set aside
                        schools where the most prominent inquiry form was
                        provided by a third-party tool like Halda, even if there
                        was evidence that the school uses Slate. More on that

                        institutions, a third of inquiry forms were 4+ clicks

                        Institutional websites serve many difficult audiences,
                        from prospective students and their families to alumni,
                        current students, faculty and staff, members of the
                        media, local communities, and more. A button on the
                        homepage is prime real estate, and with many
                        stakeholders vying for that space, it can be a challenge
                        to argue that the inquiry form should be more prominent.
                        Without it, though, prospective students may be
                        encountering more friction on your site than on those of
                        the other schools on their list. When someone is ready
                        to raise their hand and inquire, the process should be
                        smooth and intuitive.
