                        forms in 2025, we looked at how different institution
                        types approached the length and structure of their
                        inquiry forms, including, in the case of certain fields, <em

                        Classification of Institutions of Higher Education® and
                        by IPEDS data on selectivity and institution size.

                        Across all Slate institutions that had a single-page
                        form, the average inquiry form contained <strong
                            >16.3 questions</strong
                        >. This count includes questions that appeared based on
                        conditional logic for prospective first-year students
                        who were opting in to provide core contact information
                        for themselves and a parent. If a form appeared to offer
                        additional sections for students wishing to provide more
                        detailed information about athletics, extracurriculars,
                        or specialized pre-professional interests, those were
                        excluded from the count.

                        When forms are grouped into five buckets based on
                        length, we found that Baccalaureate Colleges (Arts &
                        Sciences Focus) were more likely than other types to
                        have forms at the two extremes, with either fewer than
                        10 questions or more than 25 questions:

                        3. Identifying the User: Parent or Student?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        One challenge with inquiry forms is that the person
                        filling out the form might not be the student: parents,
                        counselors, or alumni might sign up or refer a student;
                        if the wording of questions isn't clear, this can
                        sometimes lead to inquiry records being created in the
                        name of those individuals, rather than in the name of
                        the student.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some schools attempt to solve for this challenge by
                        asking an identifying question, usually at the top of
                        the form, and then either conditionally displaying
                        different sets of questions or routing the parent or
                        other individual to a dedicated form. We wanted to
                        measure how common this practice had become as of 2025,
                        and whether it was more common at certain types of
                        institutions than others.

                    <p>
                        As schools seek to engage parents directly, collecting
                        parent information at the point of inquiry can help
                        create opportunities for engagement earlier in the
                        recruitment process.
                    </p><p>
                        For many institutions that implemented Slate pre-COVID,
                        it was common to create custom person-scoped fields to
                        store parent contact information, with the standard
                        relation table only being mapped at point of
                        application. This approach was often recommended in
                        order to help avoid data issues (inconsistent email
                        addresses or spellings of parent names) from lower
                        quality sources like inquiry forms, compared to the
                        application. Discrepancies can result in duplicate
                        relation records if relationship type is not collected,
                        for example, or if first name and last name are
                        inconsistent (see <a

                    <p>
                        While many schools do still use these custom fields, the
                        majority of those that collect parent information on the
                        inquiry form do so by mapping directly to the relation
                        table. With parent information stored using relation
                        records, it becomes possible to build recipient list
                        queries using the relation base for parent

                        Engaging prospective students via text is a common
                        practice, but we observed that a significant proportion
                        of schools rely on passive disclaimer language rather
                        than standalone fields that capture explicit opt-in
                        consent.
                    </p><p>
                        Between regulations and carrier A2P compliance standards
                        requiring affirmative opt-ins, we recommend that schools
                        consult with their general counsel's office to ensure
                        their practices are compliant. Technolutions includes

                        If stakeholders are pushing for greater clarity around

                        However, this is relatively uncommon across school
                        types, and adds to form length. If gathering this

                        One solution to the problem of overly long forms is to
                        give students the choice: you can either submit right
                        away, providing only the essential data points, or, if
                        you have a few moments, provide additional details.

                        As with collecting marketing attribution data, it's
                        important to make sure the data collected in these
                        optional sections is useful and helps inform the
                        relationship you're developing, rather than simply
                        collecting data for the sake of easier reporting. It's
                        worth asking whether these additional data points could
                        be collected instead as part of a follow-up, so that the
                        focus remains on the student's needs.

                    <p>
                        While every institution takes its own approach to
                        collecting inquiry data, it's important to understand
                        the evolving practices of your peer institutions and to regularly review how your own approach compares.</p> 
                    <p> A great inquiry form experience remains centered on the student: asking only what's needed to spark further discussion and build a relationship. Reducing the friction students experience in filling out your inquiry forms is our goal with this analysis, whether that involves cutting a few fields, changing how you're
                        collecting a key data point, or giving users an
                        experience that adapts to their preferences. </p><p>As you discuss your form questions with your team, we hope this analysis helps guide those conversations toward a student experience that is intentional and focused on building great relationships.
